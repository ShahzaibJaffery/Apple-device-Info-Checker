This script allows you to communicate with Apple servers to retrieve information about Apple devices. 
You need to submit an IMEI number or a Serial number.
The script is actually coded in php but you can easily adapt it in another language, you just need a function able to decode a jSOn object into an array.
This is my first repository, if you have any comment , my e-mail is akinfermo@gmail.com
And very soon I will be releasing a script coded with an oriented object language and I will realease all the keys available in the array decoded from the json object received from Apple.
